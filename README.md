# DotNetStockApp
Project that allows users to monitor stock for their company

The objective of our project is to create an application that will allow users to better manage their companyâ€™s inventory. They will be able to easily add or remove items from the stock and update the stock level. We also want to be able to integrate order and restocking management directly into the application.
